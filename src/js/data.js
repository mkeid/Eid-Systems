            "As a biomedical science major, I had never touched code until my Sophomore year of college. It was then that I began learning front-end development in order to build a social network for my school intended to improve its night life. Although it was built only using raw HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and a shoddy LAMP stack for ther back-end, it gained popularity and inspired me to switch my major to Information Systems.",
            "Over the following years I delved more into development learned auxiliarry frameworks, libraries, and extensions including jQuery,  Sass, and redesigned the site from the ground up. I also learned Oebjective-C and iOS Development to build a native mobile application for the service. This application called \"NiteSpot\" ended up winning the Mid-Hudson Regional Business Competition and helpmed get a job at IBM my junior year of college.",
            "At work, I helped automate internal processes including my team's node allocation procedure by building a website. This site, which was globally utilized by geographically dispersed members, gave a visual representation of the 1300+ servers and provided a means to lease and request nodes from other users. It made use of a number of 3rd party libraries including Google's graphing one for representing distributional attributes.",
            "Additionally, I have aquired comprehension in the use industry standard frameworks and libraries such as React and Redux which were used to build this very site."
