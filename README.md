# [Eid Systems](http://www.eid.systems)

This is my personal full stack website developed from the ground up. Node.js, express, and MongoDB were used for the back-end while React and Redux were used for the front-end. The site is mobile accessible via media queries.

## Usage

To build assets using webpack, run the build-prod script using npm.

```
npm run build-prod
```

To launch a production server, invoke the start-prod script using npm.

```
npm run start-prod
```

To start a development server making use of webpack middleware, run start-dev using npm.

```
npm run start-dev
```
